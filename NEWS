v0.5-0  (2017-06-23)

  o A number of functions have been renamed:

      isValidISIN      => is_valid_ISIN
      closeOnFirst     => close_on_first
      plotTradingHours => plot_trading_hours
      scaleToUnity     => scale_to_unity
      scaleTrades      => scale_trades
      splitTrades      => split_trades
      twExposure       => tw_exposure

    For the time being, the old functions can still be
    called with

      PMwR:::<old-fun-name>

    but the old names shall be removed in a future
    version.

  o New 'as.matrix' method for monthly holding-period
    returns, which places returns into a numeric matrix
    with years in rows and months in columns. For other
    holding periods, as.matrix is called on the raw
    numeric data.

  o returns: argument 'period' may also be 'quarterly'
    or a single year, such as "2007"

  o btest: 'do.signal' and 'do.rebalance' can also be
    the string 'lastofquarter' to rebalance on last day
    of quarter; or 'firstofquarter' to rebalance on
    first day of quarter
